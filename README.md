# Titanic Survival Analysis

This R script examines the passenger data from the Titanic using the data.table and ggplot2 libraries. The Titanic data is converted into data.table at the beginning of the script and several columns' data types are changed.

The script provides numerous charts after processing the data to show how various factors relate to the survivability of Titanic passengers. The plots include box plots, density plots, box plots, faceted plots, bar charts, and histograms.

The following variables are used in the plots:
Survived: A factor indicating whether a passenger survived or not (1: survived, 0: not survived)
Pclass: A ordered factor indicating the passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Sex: A factor indicating the passenger's gender (male or female)
Age: The passenger's age
